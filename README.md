# The Extension for Kids who Can't Read Good



## And want to do other things good too.


### This is an extension made for Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. It works on Brave too.

In the proposal I was ambitious and only one thing seems to work at the end of the day. For a few weeks I attempted to get contextual blurring working so that only the words around the cursor are legible, so that people with dyslexia and ADHD have an easier time focusing on them.

In working with document ranges, I have found that ranges have a lot of rules I'm still not aware of. The result is primitive and I have some regrets. I made one out of three goals a reality, separating text to a separate window using work from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2444430/how-to-get-a-word-under-cursor-using-javascript). The rest of the time was trying to finagle ranges into selecting an entire div and blurring things out of the cursor range. There are [other](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range/commonAncestorContainer) [leads](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/wiki/Rangy-Object) I was looking at as the project time came to a close.
